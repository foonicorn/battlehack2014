	<h2>Welcome to Cha+Cha</h2>
	<p>
		Cha+Cha is the short name for Challenge+Charity
	</p>
	<p>
		With Charitya+Cha you can invite a friend to a challenge - let's say "I bet I can stay up longer than you!". But instead of gambling for a cup of coffee, you agree on a small amount of money which the loser has to donate to a charity.
