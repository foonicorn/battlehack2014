BattleHack2014 / Cha+Cha
========================

About
-----

Cha+Cha is the short name for Challenge+Charity.

This App is all about doing something good while challenging your friends.
Instead of gambling for a bottle of beer, the looser will donate a small
amount of money to a charity organization.

This app was developed in just 24 hours during BattleHack 2014, a hackathon
sponsored by PayPal.

It utilizes the PayPal-API with delayed payments that are captured / voided
later when the challenge has been finished.
